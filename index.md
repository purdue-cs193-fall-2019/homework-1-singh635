# Ayushman"s First CS193 Homework

- I like how CS 193 gives us the skills neccessary to utilise our programming knowledge in real life to the fullest.
- I like how the CS 193 class is smaller than the usual lecture halls and that gives us more chances to interact with our peers and our teachers.
- I love how friendly and relatable the CS193 teachers are because they themselves are students and they make it their goal to make sure we learn as well as enjoy the class.
